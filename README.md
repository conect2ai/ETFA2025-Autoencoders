## üìñ Abstract

The growing integration of sensors and embedded devices into distributed Internet of Things (IoT) systems has increased the demand for real-time data collection and processing solutions. However, the high volume and frequency of sensor data create challenges related to storage, transmission, and response latency, especially in resource-constrained environments. In this context, locally executed compression techniques, aligned with the Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) paradigm, become differentiators for enabling embedded applications. Thus, this work proposes an autoencoder-based approach for efficiently compressing sensor data on edge devices. Three autoencoder variants (feedforward, sparse, and contractive) are evaluated, combined with symmetric and asymmetric architectures, considering criteria such as compression ratio, information preservation, and embedded execution feasibility. For practical validation, a case study was conducted using vehicular data collected via the OBD-II interface, where the selected models were deployed on the OBD-II Edge Freematics One+ device. The results show that the models could reduce data dimensionality with minimal information loss, maintain competitive performance on discriminative tasks, and exhibit inference times compatible with real-time applications. Autoencoders represent a viable neural compression solution for IoT environments, potentially applicable to various embedded sensing scenarios.
